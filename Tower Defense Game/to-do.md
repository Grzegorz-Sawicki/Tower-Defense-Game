## To-Do

- tower:
1. 5 projectile towers. 3 single target, 2 with additional aoe

- enemy:
1. moves left-right or top-bottom
2. avoids towers on path (if not flying), strafes or turns to avoid collision
3. has different types

- tower radius:
1. if center of enemy in radius - change tower state to active
	

- grid made of tiles, where you can place towers
1. grid size 28x24
2. 6 space to pass horizontal, 8 space to pass vertical
3. towers take 2x2 space
